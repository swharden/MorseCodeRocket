# Morse Code Rocket

**Morse Code Rocket** is a web app for practicing Morse code decoding by listening to interesting text from user supplied webpages. Morse Code Rocket's adjustable keying speed favors the _Farnsworth technique_ of learning code, where users train to recognize "fast" letters sent with large gaps between (e.g., 20 WPM letters sent at 10 WPM).
